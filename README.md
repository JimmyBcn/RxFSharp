# RxFSharp

This is essentially a snippet collection repository showing the basic usage of **Rx.Net** library using **F#** as the programming language.

The uploaded code and samples are the result of my own spikes, which helped me for both a better understanding on how Rx works, and also practice writing F# code, as I&#39;m not too much familiarized.

This is a work in progress. Hope you find it useful somehow, too.

This project pretends to be a starting point towards a better understanding and knowledge of advanced Event Driven Architectures, taking the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) as a mantra.
